<h2>Summary</h2>

Bloccit is part of the Bloc Backend foundation course and is essentially a clone of the popular website Reddit. It will allow users to create topics or posts.

<h2>Explanation</h2>

This project was built with guidance from my Bloc mentor. Bloc walks me through the creation of a application feature and then I use what I've learned to implement a similar feature.
For example, after adding the ability to comment on a post my assignment would be to allow users to submit a question. The ultimate goal being to gain an understanding of how an entire application is built from the ground up.

<h2>Problem</h2>

Users will need to be able to create, edit, and delete posts as well as vote and comment on others. The application will also include a few different roles. The objective is to understand the backend development process and how to
work with the model, view and controller. 

<h2>Solution</h2>

One of the most important concepts in building Bloccit is Test Driven Development. This is the process of creating failing tests and then implenting the proper method or view. I found myself running RSpec religously to make sure my
code was functioning properly. The process was meticulous but I found it incredibly helpful in debugging my code.


<h2>Result</h2>

**Features**

- Users can create an account in order to create a topic or post.
- Users can comment and vote on posts.
- Lastly, users can favorite a post which is then saved to their profile.


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The Bloccit project taught me how to work with the model, view and controller as well as object-oriented programming. At this point in my coding journey I felt debugging was one of my weak points, but the methods used to debug
code is definitely one aspect I really enjoy about Ruby on Rails.

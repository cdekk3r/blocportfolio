<h2>Summary</h2>

BlocJams is a digital music player application compatible with web browser or mobile device. It demonstrate my knowledge of Frontend web development.

<h2>Explanation</h2>

The objective being to gain a better understanding of best practices using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It would first be built using DOM Scripting and then refactored using jQuery.

<h2>Problem</h2>

Throughout the project pieces of code were provided with the goal being connect the dots in order to create a useable music player. Refactoring the code from DOM scripting to jQuery gave me the opportunity to see the variance 
between frameworks. 

<h2>Solution</h2>

Before beginning the actual coding portion of this project I would need to become familiar with GitHub. After constantly creating new branches, commiting, and pushing I feel much more comfortable using the management system. 
JavaScript will be the language of choice. On top of examples included in the curriculum I would also take advantage of reading blog posts and other resources.

<h2>Result</h2>

While Bloc does provide guidance throughout the project it was up to me to understand the concepts and apply them. I found myself using live preview constantly to check if my functions were working properly. At times the browser
developer tools would help pin down issues. The end result was a working music player.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

With Blocjams being my first project of the course it gave perspective to what is required in the construction of an application. My understanding of the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript structure improved. I feel much more
comfortable working with GitHub and git branches. Lastly, it introduced me to the incessant use of search engines to look up documentation or examples.
